<h1>John's Favorite Family Night Movies</h1>
<h2>The Movies I Enjoy That The Kids Can Watch too!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Lego Movie</h3>
<P>Really funny, goofy stuff.  Great cast of comedians.</P>
<h3>The Iron Giant</h3>
<P>Great mix of childlike wonder and the idea of nature vs nurture.  Emotionally
     potent.</P>
<h3>Wallace and Gromet: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit</h3>
<p>Such cool claymation!  WHY IS NO ONE DOING CLAY ANYMORE!  Really funny, 
    interesting little mystery with lots of neat animation sequences and 
    good ol' fashion Brittish humor.</p>
